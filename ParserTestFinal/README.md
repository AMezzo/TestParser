## Scope of Work

Mark each of the requirements you completed by adding an X in between the square brackets. If you have any comments for a given section, add them in the "Comments from student" section (i.e. I almost finished this, but 3 tests aren't passing).

| Requirement                                                      | Completed? | Comments from student |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| 1. Lexer copied from assignment 2                                | [X]        | Lexer copied and updated following Assignment 1 feedback and review done in class |
| 2. Parser updated to include new productions                     | [X]        | Parser updated and successfully made new nodes to handle new grammar, but tests seems to keep failing      |                                     

## Results and Conclusions

### What I Learned

Although my project initially presented numerous uncertainties due to its first-time implementation and logic, and despite encountering numerous challenges along the way, I acquired fundamental knowledge of nodes, trees, and parser mechanisms, as well as the operational mechanics of parsing engines. While there remain aspects that require further exploration and comprehension, the knowledge gained has proven to be invaluable thus far.

### Challenges I Encountered

I encountered the greatest difficulty when trying to connect nodes to the parser, although they now appear to be connected appropriately. Additionally, I faced challenges in using 'java compiler.Compiler simple.x -image' and consequently had to resort to using 'java -cp target compiler.Compiler ./xsamples/simple.x' instead.
